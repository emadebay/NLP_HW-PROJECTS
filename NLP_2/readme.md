This Python script, nlp_analysis_toolkit.py, provides a set of functions for natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as tokenization, frequency analysis, and probability calculation. Below is a summary of the functionalities provided by each section of the script:

Importing Libraries: This section imports necessary libraries such as nltk for NLP tasks.
Helper Functions: These functions include remove_punctuation, convert_to_lowercase, remove_sentence_that_ends_dot, add_begin_token_and_end_token, and flatten_extend. These functions perform preprocessing steps such as removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, and adding tokens to mark sentence beginnings and endings.
Counting Non-Zero Ngrams: The count_non_zero_ngrams function calculates the total number of non-zero unigrams and bigrams in the dataset.
Most Common Unigrams and Their Probability: This section calculates the ten most common unigrams and their probabilities using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for both the news and romance datasets.
Most Common Bigrams and Their Probability: Similarly, this section calculates the ten most common bigrams and their probabilities using MLE for both datasets.
Probability of a Given Sentence: The Probability_of_a_given_sentence function calculates the probability of a given sentence using bigram models for both datasets.
Probability of a Given Sentence with Laplace Add-One Smoothing: This section calculates the probability of a given sentence using bigram models with Laplace Add-One smoothing for both datasets.
To use this script, make sure to have nltk installed and download the brown corpus by running nltk.download('brown'). Then, execute the script in a Python environment, and it will provide the desired NLP analysis functionalities.
